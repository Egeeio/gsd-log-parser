## Purpose

gsd-log-parser is designed to work with dedicated game servers created with the [gsd-cli](https://github.com/Egeeio/gsd-cli). gsd-log-parser runs as a daemon and perodically parses journald for new players joining the server. When a new player joins, the player name is published to Redis, where another gsd service publishes the players to a Discord server.
